# PathDiff : Histopathology Image Synthesis with Unpaired Text and Mask Conditions**

---

## üìñ Overview

PathDiff is a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-quality histopathology images by jointly leveraging **unpaired** text reports and cell-type masks. Unlike prior methods that require paired annotations, PathDiff learns from two separate datasets, one with image‚Äìtext pairs and one with image‚Äìmask pairs, and at inference time can synthesize images conditioned on: **Text** only or **Mask** only or **Both text & mask**.

## Abstract
Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints. Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks offer fine-
grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image generation. This constraint
restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.
